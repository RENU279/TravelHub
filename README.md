Tour Management system for TravelTour

As tourism is one of the fastest growing industries today, thus within the tourism industry events
are getting more and more important. People have become more interested in events of all kinds,
and will travel far away to participate in events that they find interesting. Events can offer various
economical and social benefits for destinations, and therefore destination managers can and should
employ events effectively in a tourism role. It has become widely accepted that every community
and destination needs to adopt a long-term, strategic approach to event tourism thereby planning
and development in order to realise the full tourism potential of events. 

This is a travel based website which caters to the need of tourists. This study was launched
as a response to the lack of studies on how Tours strategies are actually used in destinations. The
study was directed to tours and travel management system and the aim was to explore Tour and
Travel packages. We offer tour and travel services including ticket bookings, hotel reservations ,
rental car services, holiday tour packages, domestic tour packages. We provide the most suitably
designed as well as the customized travel packages to the customers. We offer everything related
to travelling services under one roof.
